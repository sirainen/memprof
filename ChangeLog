Sat Nov 20 17:14:40 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* bfdutils.c (process_map_sections): Try accessing
	section->_cooked_size to deal with bug(?) in older
	binutils.

	* memintercept.c (STACK_MAX_SIZE): Change PIPE_BUF to
	#define constant since we no longer use pipes.

        [ Sync CVS with my current tree. This commit destabilizes
	  things a bit, but adds neat new features like
	  correct tracing of threaded programs; some options like
	  turning off following forks not yet implemented ]
	
	* memintercept.[ch]: Major reworking of the way we handle
	intercepting malloc() and friends - the __malloc_hook
	functionality is inherently not thread safe. So
	directly override the functions in our LD_PRELOAD.
	Also, override fork(), clone() and exec() and report these
	back to our parent to allow tracing of threads and
	forking programs.

	* process.c memintercept.c: Change the mechanism for
	communicating with subprocesses from a single pipe to
	a Unix domain socket with accepts connections for
	new subprocesses.
	
	* process.c: Completely rework handling of getting input
	from multiple processes. Add a command-queue to deal
	with recieving out-of-order input from multiple threads
	within a single process.
	
	* main.c: Allow multiple process windows, create new
	process windows when a fork or exec occurs.
	
	* Makefile.am: add -ldl to LIBADD for libmemintercept.so,
	since we now use DL functions to get original symbols. 

        * process.c bfdutils.c memprof.h: Add an exported demangle function,
	store symbol names demangled.

	* README: Add note for Debian users telling them to
	install binutils-dev.

1999-11-17  Elker Cavina <e.cavina@ra.nettuno.it>

       * configure.in: Added it to ALL_LINGUAS
	
Thu Nov  4 13:14:36 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* process.c: Re-indent to Linux style.

	* memprof.glade main.c (process_window_destroy): Add ability
	to close windows.

1999-11-15  Martin Norbäck  <d95mback@dtek.chalmers.se>

	* configure.in: Added sv to ALL_LINGUAS

Thu Oct 28 09:22:42 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* process.c (process_find_exec): Fix extra free
	in case where executable is not found. 
	(Pointed out by Sven Neumann <neumann@simul.biophys.uni-duesseldorf.de>)

Wed Oct 27 20:58:03 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* main.c: (update_status) if current_process->n_allocations,
	  don't divide by it and just strdup a "-"

Wed Oct 27 16:22:03 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* Released 0.3.0

Wed Oct 27 15:17:08 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* process.c (input_func): Remove a bunch of duplicate
	code - we don't need separate malloc/realloc/free cases.

	* process.c (input_func): Fix stupid unitialized
	variable.

Wed Oct 27 12:26:02 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* memintercept.c: Reindent to linux style

	* memintercept.c (stack_trace): Write out output in
	single write() call to ensure atomicity.

	* memintercept.c (my_free_hook): Changed hooks
	to match glibc-2.1 prototypes

	* *.[ch]: Added copyrights to source files.

	* main.c process.c process.h: Pass pre-split args
	into process_run(), add functions for splitting
	args and finding the executable.

	* main.c: Add code from Michael Meeks <michael@nuclecu.unam.mx>
	for specifying the program to debug from the command
	line.

Mon Oct 25 15:17:38 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: add a -ldl fallback test for libiberty

Wed Oct 20 19:59:16 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* main.c (DEFAULT_STACK_COMMAND): Use emacsclient instead of 
	gnudoit because emacsclient is standard.

	* process.c (read_inode): Fix mem leak found by MemProf.

Wed Oct 20 18:46:22 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* process.c (process_init): Look in libdir, not pkgdatadir
	for libmemintercept.so

	* process.c (process_init): Look in .libs for libmemintercept.so
	so things work in the non-installed case.

	* configure.in (MEMPROF_LIBS): Use right -l flags when
	checking for -lbfd.
