Memprof is a memory profiler and leak detector.

Requirements
============

 For the interface, memprof requires:

  - GTK+ 2.0
  - gconf 2.0
  - libgnomeui 2.0
  - libglade 2.0

 For the backend, memprof currently requires:

  - libbfd and libiberty from the GNU binutils distribution.
    (Debian users will probably need to install the binutils-dev package)
  - Linux (kernel version 2.2 will work better)
  - GNU libc (2.0 or 2.1 will work, but 2.0 may produce warnings 
              when compiling)

Installation
============

./configure
make
make install
