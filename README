Memprof is a memory profiler and leak detector.

Requirements
============

 For the interface, memprof requires:

  - GTK+        
  - gnome-libs  
  - libglade

 For the backend memprof currently requires:

  - Linux (kernel version 2.2 will work better)
  - GNU libc (2.0 or 2.1 will work, but 2.0 may produce warnings 
              when compiling)
